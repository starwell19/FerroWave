## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing code, make sure you have:

1. **Arduino IDE** (1.8.x or 2.x)
2. **ESP32 board support** (version 2.0.14+)
3. **Required libraries** (see [LIBRARIES.md](docs/LIBRARIES.md))
4. **ESP32-A1S Audio Kit** (recommended for testing)
5. Basic understanding of C++ and Arduino

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/FerroWave.git
   cd FerroWave
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** (libraries via Arduino Library Manager)
4. **Open the firmware** in Arduino IDE
5. **Test on hardware** if possible

---

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Create an Issue First

Before starting work on a new feature or major change:

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Create a new issue** describing:
   - What you want to add/change
   - Why it's useful
   - How you plan to implement it
3. **Wait for feedback** from maintainers

For bug fixes, you can skip this step if the issue already exists.

### 2. Create a Branch

Create a descriptive branch name:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-magnet-mode
git checkout -b fix/led-flicker-issue
git checkout -b docs/wiring-improvements
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

**Code Guidelines:**
- Follow existing code style and formatting
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Test thoroughly on hardware if possible
- Don't break existing functionality

**Documentation Guidelines:**
- Use clear, simple language
- Include examples where helpful
- Add images/diagrams if relevant
- Proofread for spelling and grammar

### 4. Test Your Changes

**For Code Changes:**
- Compile without errors
- Test on actual hardware if possible
- Verify existing features still work
- Check Serial Monitor output
- Test with different presets/modes

**For Documentation:**
- Read through your changes
- Check all links work
- Verify formatting renders correctly
- Test any code examples provided

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Write clear commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new RIPPLE magnet mode for water-like effects"
```

**Good commit message examples:**
- `Fix LED flickering on mode change`
- `Add Spanish translation to README`
- `Improve battery life with sleep mode`
- `Update wiring diagram for clarity`

**Bad commit message examples:**
- `fixes`
- `update`
- `changes`

### 6. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/new-magnet-mode
```

Then on GitHub:
1. Go to your fork
2. Click "Pull Request"
3. Fill in the PR template with:
   - **Description**: What does this PR do?
   - **Motivation**: Why is this change needed?
   - **Testing**: How did you test it?
   - **Screenshots**: If visual changes, include images
   - **Related Issues**: Link any related issues

### 7. Respond to Feedback

- Be open to suggestions
- Make requested changes promptly
- Ask questions if feedback is unclear
- Be respectful and professional

## Code Style Guidelines

### General Principles

- **Readable over clever**: Clear code is better than short code
- **Comment non-obvious logic**: Explain *why*, not just *what*
- **Consistent naming**: Follow existing conventions
- **Avoid blocking delays**: Use millis() timing instead of delay()

### Naming Conventions

```cpp
// Constants: ALL_CAPS with underscores
const int LED_PIN = 23;
const float MAX_DUTY = 80.0f;

// Variables: camelCase
float dutyPct = 0.0f;
int ledBrightness = 100;

// Functions: camelCase
void updateLEDs() { }
float clampf(float x, float lo, float hi) { }

// Enums: PascalCase for type, ALL_CAPS for values
enum VisualizationMode {
  MODE_SMOOTH = 1,
  MODE_SPIKE = 2
};
```

### Code Formatting

```cpp
// Use spaces, not tabs (2 spaces per indent level)
if (condition) {
  doSomething();
}

// Braces on same line for functions
void myFunction() {
  // code here
}

// Space after keywords
if (x > 0) { }
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { }
while (running) { }

// No space after function names
myFunction();
Serial.println("text");
```

### Comments

```cpp
// Good: Explain WHY
// Use fast attack for percussive sounds
envFast = (1.0f - attackAlpha) * envFast + attackAlpha * level;

// Bad: Explain WHAT (obvious from code)
// Set envFast to the result of the calculation
envFast = (1.0f - attackAlpha) * envFast + attackAlpha * level;

// Good: Document non-obvious behavior
// PWM frequency below 10Hz creates visible pulsing effect
if (pwmFreqHz < 10.0f) {
  // ...
}
```

### Performance Considerations

```cpp
// ✅ Good: Non-blocking
unsigned long lastUpdate = 0;
if (millis() - lastUpdate > 100) {
  updateLEDs();
  lastUpdate = millis();
}

// ❌ Bad: Blocking (causes audio stutter)
updateLEDs();
delay(100);

// ✅ Good: Efficient
float value = envFast * sensitivity;

// ❌ Bad: Unnecessary division in loop
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  float value = envFast * (sensitivity / 100.0f);
}
```

## Adding New Features

### Adding a New Magnet Mode

1. Add to enum in main sketch:
   ```cpp
   enum VisualizationMode {
     MODE_SMOOTH  = 1,
     MODE_SPIKE   = 2,
     // ... existing modes ...
     MODE_YOUR_NEW_MODE = 9
   };
   ```

2. Add case to `calculateDuty()` function:
   ```cpp
   case MODE_YOUR_NEW_MODE:
     // Your algorithm here
     output = yourCalculation();
     break;
   ```

3. Update `modeName()` function:
   ```cpp
   case MODE_YOUR_NEW_MODE: return "YOUR_NAME";
   ```

4. Update documentation (README.md, commands.md)
5. Test thoroughly with different music styles

### Adding a New LED Mode

1. Add to LED mode selection:
   ```cpp
   case 11: // New mode number
     // Your LED effect code
     break;
   ```

2. Update `ledModeName()` function
3. Update max mode count
4. Document the new mode
5. Test with different audio inputs
