# FerroWave

Audio-reactive **ferrofluid visualizer** built on **ESP32-A1S (ES8388)**.  
Streams Bluetooth audio (A2DP) or AUX input into the on-board codec, extracts live envelopes, and drives:

* a **coil + MOSFET trigger module** (PWM on GPIO 22) for ferrofluid motion
* a **WS2812B LED ring** (GPIO 23) for synced visuals
* **Six onboard buttons** for live preset control (no computer needed!)

> Created by **Makarov87** and **crowdfunded by the MakerWorld community**.

## Project Status (AUX + Button Control Edition)

This repo reflects the **latest "AUX + Button Control Edition"** firmware with the finalized hardware layout.

**What's new in this version:**

* **AUX Input Support**: Auto-detects when 3.5mm cable is plugged in and switches from Bluetooth
* **Physical Button Controls**: Six onboard buttons for live control without serial/computer
  + Cycle through magnet modes (8 presets)
  + Cycle through LED effects (10 modes)
  + Switch between EQ presets (8 audio profiles)
* **Dual Input**: Seamlessly switch between Bluetooth and AUX input
* **Non-blocking performance**: Fixed audio stuttering issues for smooth playback

**Previous improvements:**

* Switched to **4x18650 battery pack** with breadboard power distribution:
  + Portable, cordless operation
  + Clean 5V rail for all components
  + 1-1.5 hours runtime typical
  + Simple, no voltage converters needed
* Low-side **MOSFET trigger module** (AOD4184-style):
  + Built-in flyback diode + status LED
  + 3.3 V logic input, 5V coil output
  + Much more maker-friendly than raw MOSFET wiring
* Finalized **pinout** to avoid conflicts with ES8388 codec and onboard buttons:
  + GPIO 22 → **MOSFET gate** (coil PWM)
  + GPIO 23 → **WS2812B LED DIN**
  + ES8388 on standard I²S pins (27 / 25 / 26 / 35 / 0)

## Troubleshooting

**No power?** Check battery charge and connections
