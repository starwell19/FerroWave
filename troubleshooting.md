### Random Resets or Brownouts

**Symptoms:**
- ESP32 restarts unexpectedly
- LEDs dim when coil activates
- Serial Monitor shows boot messages repeatedly

**Solutions:**

1. **Insufficient Current**
   ```
   Problem: Total current draw exceeds battery capacity
   
   Fix:
   - Reduce LED brightness: l80
   - Lower max duty: d70
   - Use less aggressive magnet mode
   - Check battery capacity (use higher capacity cells)
   ```

2. **Poor Connections**
   ```
   Problem: Loose wires cause voltage drops
   
   Fix:
   - Check USB cable connection
   - Verify breadboard power connections
   - Ensure all wires are secure
   - Check for oxidized contacts
   ```

3. **Battery Depletion**
   ```
   Problem: Batteries running low
   
   Fix:
   - Charge batteries via Micro-USB
   - Monitor battery indicator
   - Replace with fresh batteries
   ```

---

### Voltage Too Low/High

**Symptoms:**
- Measured voltage at ESP32 is not 5V
- Components behave erratically

**Solutions:**

**If voltage is low (<4.5V):**
- Battery is depleted - charge or replace
- Power module failing - test or replace
- Too much current draw - reduce load
- USB cable resistance - use shorter/thicker cable

**If voltage is high (>5.5V):**
- Power module misconfigured - check settings
- Replace power module (may be faulty)
- Don't exceed 5.5V - may damage ESP32

## Electromagnet Issues

### Coil Doesn't Activate

**Symptoms:**
- No magnetic field
- Ferrofluid doesn't move
- Test pulse `t` does nothing

**Solutions:**

1. **Check MOSFET Module**
   ```
   - Verify power (VCC and GND connected)
   - Check module LED (should light when active)
   - Measure voltage at gate pin
   - Try different MOSFET module
   ```

2. **Test GPIO 22**
   ```
   Serial Monitor: type 't' for test pulse
   
   Expected:
   - MOSFET LED lights up
   - Coil gets warm
   - 2 second pulse
   ```

3. **Verify Coil**
   ```
   - Measure coil resistance (should be 2-10Ω typically)
   - Check coil connections
   - Test coil directly with 5V (briefly!)
   ```

4. **Check Wiring**
   ```
   Coil (+) → Breadboard (+) rail (5V)
   Coil (-) → MOSFET DRAIN
   MOSFET SOURCE → Breadboard (-) rail (GND)
   GPIO 22 → MOSFET GATE (direct connection)
   ```

---

### Coil Always On

**Symptoms:**
- Magnet never turns off
- Coil gets very hot
- Can't control via software

**Solutions:**

1. **Check for Short**
   ```
   - Power OFF
   - Disconnect gate wire from GPIO 22
   - If coil still on, MOSFET is shorted
   - Replace MOSFET module
   ```

2. **GPIO Stuck High**
   ```
   - Measure voltage at GPIO 22 (should be ~0V when idle)
   - If stuck high, ESP32 issue
   - Try different GPIO pin
   ```

---

### Weak Magnetic Field

**Symptoms:**
- Ferrofluid barely moves
- Expected more dramatic effect

**Solutions:**

1. **Increase Power**
   ```
   Serial commands:
   d90  (increase max duty to 90%)
   s150 (increase sensitivity to 150%)
   ```

2. **Try Different Mode**
   ```
   Try aggressive modes:
   2 (SPIKE)
   4 (CHAOS)
   ```

3. **Check Voltage**
   ```
   - Measure voltage at coil when active
   - Should be close to 5V
   - If much lower, voltage drop issue
   ```

---

### Coil Overheating

**Symptoms:**
- Coil gets very hot to touch
- Plastic melting smell
- System shuts down

**Solutions:**

1. **Reduce Duty Cycle**
   ```
   Serial commands:
   d60  (lower max duty)
   b5   (lower base duty)
   ```

2. **Use Higher Frequency**
   ```
   Serial command:
   f100  (higher frequency = less heating)
   ```

3. **Add Cooling**
   ```
   - Mount heatsink to coil
   - Add small fan
   - Improve airflow around coil
   ```

---

## LED Problems

### LEDs Don't Light Up

**Symptoms:**
- Ring stays dark
- No startup animation
- All modes show nothing

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Power**
   ```
   - Verify LED VCC connected to (+) rail (5V)
   - Verify LED GND connected to (-) rail
   - Measure voltage at LED strip (should be 5V)
   ```

2. **Check Data Connection**
   ```
   - GPIO 23 → 330Ω resistor → LED DIN
   - Verify resistor is present
   - Check for broken wire
   ```

3. **Increase Brightness**
   ```
   Serial command: l255
   Sets maximum brightness
   ```

4. **Try Different Mode**
   ```
   Serial commands:
   c1  (rainbow - easiest to see)
   c3  (solid blue pulse)
   ```

---

### Wrong Colors or Glitching

**Symptoms:**
- Colors are incorrect
- Random flickering
- Some LEDs wrong color

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Ground**
   ```
   CRITICAL: LED GND must share ground with ESP32
   
   - Verify common ground connection
   - Use breadboard (-) rail for all grounds
   - Check continuity
   ```

2. **Data Line Issues**
   ```
   - Check 330Ω resistor is present
   - Keep data wire short (< 12 inches)
   - Route away from power wires
   ```

3. **Power Insufficient**
   ```
   - Reduce LED brightness: l100
   - LEDs draw a lot of current at full white
   ```

---

## Button Issues

### Buttons Don't Respond

**Symptoms:**
- Pressing buttons does nothing
- No Serial output when pressed

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Firmware**
   ```
   - Ensure using latest firmware with button support
   - Verify button code is present
   - Check Serial output for button messages
   ```

2. **Verify Button Pins**
   ```
   ESP32-A1S button pins:
   GPIO 36, 39, 34, 35, 32, 33
   
   - These are built into the board
   - Check pin mappings in code
   ```

---

## Performance Issues

### Laggy Response

**Symptoms:**
- Delay between audio and visual response
- Sluggish magnet/LED updates

**Solutions:**

1. **Ensure Latest Firmware**
   ```
   - Old versions had blocking delays
   - Update to non-blocking version
   ```

2. **Reduce Serial Output**
   ```
   - Lots of Serial.print() slows system
   - Comment out debug messages
   ```

---

## Battery Problems

### Battery Drains Quickly

**Symptoms:**
- Only runs for 20-30 minutes
- Battery gets warm

**Solutions:**

1. **Reduce Power Consumption**
   ```
   - Lower LED brightness: l80
   - Use lower magnet modes: 1 or 8
   - Reduce max duty: d70
   ```

2. **Check Battery Health**
   ```
   - Use higher capacity cells (3500mAh)
   - Check battery age (old batteries = less capacity)
   - Ensure all 4 cells are balanced
   ```

---

### Battery Won't Charge

**Symptoms:**
- No charging indicator
- Batteries don't charge via Micro-USB

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Charger**
   ```
